    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshanchandna" target="_blank">Roshan Chandna</a>. 
    I recently graduated from <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a> with a major in computer science and a minor in psychological and brain sciences.
    I am now seeking a product management role at a fast growing company, where I can make a strong impact.
    My previous internship experiences include product management internships at <a href="https://www.rubrik.com/" target="_blank">Rubrik</a> and <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/" target="_blank">Sumo Logic</a>, an investment analyst internship at <a href="https://www.octahedroncapital.com/" target="_blank">Octahedron Capital</a>, and a VC internship at <a href="https://www.floodgate.com/" target="_blank">Floodgate Fund</a>.
    I also co-founded <a href="https://thetakeoff.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Takeoff</a>, a newsletter where I interviewed successful founders and investors, and published articles related to startups and technology.</p>
